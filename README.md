# domain-specific-academic-dataset
This repository contain a collection of URLs that can be used to mine domain-specific academic datasets.

Data were used to train and test a supervised machine learning-based summarization approach presented in the paper: **currently under review**. 

The source files are organized as follows:

- `urls_test_ai.txt` contains a set of URLs to access the publications part of the **AIPubSumm** test set.
- `urls_train_ai.txt` contains a set of URLs to access the publications part of the **AIPubSumm** train set.
- `urls_test_bio.txt` contains a set of URLs to access the publications part of the **BioPubSumm** test set.
- `urls_train_bio.txt` contains a set of URLs to access the publications part of the **BioPubSumm** train set.

This data format relies on specific script borrowed by the [scientific-paper-summarisation repository](https://github.com/EdCo95/scientific-paper-summarisation/tree/master/DataDownloader)
